dolfin_dg utility module
========================

Install in the usual way with your preferred prefix:

```
python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local
```


What does it do?
================

Offers utility functions for the automatic computation of DG FE formulations
using the UFL component of the FEniCS project.

==================

DG formulations are horribly complicated. This project aims to reduce human
error by automating their generation.
